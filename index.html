      Hello, my name is <strong>Angelo Adame</strong>, and I am currently a
      <br />
      4th-year student at <strong>Isabela State University</strong>, pursuing a
      <strong>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</strong>. <br />
      My passion for technology and problem-solving<br />
      drives my academic journey. Outside of my studies, I enjoy
      <strong>playing online</strong> <br />
      games, which provide a fun and interactive way to unwind and connect
      with<br />
      friends. <strong>Listening to music</strong> is another favorite pastime
      of mine, offering<br />
      a perfect escape and a source of inspiration. Additionally, I have a
      deep<br />
      affection for <strong>cats</strong> , appreciating their independent yet
      affectionate nature.
